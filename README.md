# this is a prototype for a website in which i will be displaying multiple pokedexes for the user to scroll through and choose to view. currently only displays the generation 1 pokedex: more will be added as i work on it. html, css, and vanilla javascript have been used for this project

to-do list:
  -add pokemon cries when clicked on their name
  -implement vertical draggable list scroll
  -clean up type boxes so they don't overlap with the name list
